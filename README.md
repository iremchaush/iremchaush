Hello! 👋 I'm Irem

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 😊 <br>
I'm an aspiring programmer passionate about technology and development. <br>
Currently, I'm learning and working on expanding my skills in various programming languages and technologies.

📚 What I'm Learning:<br>
C# - Exploring object-oriented programming and building applications.<br>
JavaScript - Diving into web development with interactive front-end features.<br>
HTML & CSS - Learning to create well-structured and beautifully styled web pages.<br>
SQL - Building a solid foundation in database management and querying.<br>

🏐 Outside of Programming:<br>
When I'm not coding, you can usually find me enjoying sports and exercising to stay active and healthy. <br>
I also love spending quality time with friends, whether it's hanging out or trying new activities. And of course, I cherish my "me time" to recharge and focus on personal growth. 💪

💻 My Goals:<br>
Develop more in web and software development.<br>
Create meaningful projects to apply my skills.<br>
Collaborate with others in the tech community.<br>
