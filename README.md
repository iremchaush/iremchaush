Hello! 👋 I'm Irem

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 😊 
I'm an aspiring programmer passionate about technology and development. 
Currently, I'm learning and working on expanding my skills in various programming languages and technologies.

📚 What I'm Learning:

C# - Exploring object-oriented programming and building applications.
JavaScript - Diving into web development with interactive front-end features.
HTML & CSS - Learning to create well-structured and beautifully styled web pages.
SQL - Building a solid foundation in database management and querying.
I'm always eager to learn more and grow in the programming world! 🚀

🏐 Outside of Programming:

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me enjoying sports and exercising to stay active and healthy. 
I also love spending quality time with friends, whether it's hanging out or trying new activities. And of course, I cherish my "me time" to recharge and focus on personal growth. 💪

💻 My Goals:

Develop more in web and software development.
Create meaningful projects to apply my skills.
Collaborate with others in the tech community.
